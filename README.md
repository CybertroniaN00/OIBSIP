# Task 4 - Research Report on Common Network Security Threats 
 
As part of my cybersecurity internship at Oasis Infobyte, this task focuses on researching some of the most common and dangerous network security threats. 
The report explores how attacks like Denial-of-Service \(DoS\), Man-in-the-Middle \(MITM\), and spoofing work, what kind of real-world damage they can cause, and how organizations and individuals can protect against them. 
This task helped me better understand the critical role of network security in today's connected world and is one of the required submissions for completing the internship.
