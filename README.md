# README – Network Security Threats Report

## Overview

This report, titled **“Network Security Threats”**, was prepared as part of **Task 1** under the **Oasis Infobyte Security Analyst Internship**. It explores both widely known and modern network security threats, focusing on their attack mechanisms, real-world examples, impact, and mitigation strategies.

## Research Methodology

The research for this report was carried out by:

- Studying official documentation from organizations such as NIST, OWASP, and CISA
- Referring to whitepapers, articles, and technical blogs from credible cybersecurity sources
- Analyzing real-world cyber incidents reported in news outlets and security bulletins
- Comparing current trends using threat intelligence from platforms like Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, and IBM X-Force

The report categorizes threats into:

- Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks  
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks  
- Spoofing attacks (including IP, ARP, DNS, and Email spoofing)  
- Phishing and its variants  
- Recently observed network-based threat patterns

Each category includes definitions, techniques, types, attack vectors, real-world examples, impact assessments, and mitigation approaches.

## Findings & Results

The report concludes the following:

- Many network security threats, while known for decades, are still relevant and continue to evolve in sophistication.
- Human error, lack of patch management, and poor network configurations remain among the top contributing factors for successful attacks.
- Phishing attacks are the most widely used vector for initial access in modern breaches due to their low cost and high effectiveness.
- MITM and spoofing attacks pose serious risks in environments where encryption, authentication, and DNS protection are not enforced.
- DoS and DDoS attacks are increasingly used not only for disruption but also as smokescreens for more complex intrusions.
- Each threat type was supported with recent real-world case studies to showcase practical relevance and scale.
- The report emphasizes a combination of technical solutions (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS, DNSSEC) and human-centric strategies (e.g., awareness training, email verification protocols) as the best defense.
