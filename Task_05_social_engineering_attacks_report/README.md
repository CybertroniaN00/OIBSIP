This report was created as part of Task 5 of the OIBSIP Internship and focuses on the topic of social engineering attacks. The goal was to explore and explain the 
different forms of social engineering — mainly phishing, pretexting, and baiting — along with how they work, real-world case studies, their impact, and how such 
attacks can be mitigated. The content is based on extensive research using credible cybersecurity sources and official websites, without relying on auto-generated 
material. I ensured the information is accurate, easy to understand, and formatted cleanly using Markdown and Notepad++ for clarity. Each section follows a consistent 
structure with subheadings and examples, offering both technical insight and practical advice. This report reflects the effort to combine academic understanding with 
real-world relevance, and I’ve included references to support every major point. It was written with care to maintain a natural tone and avoid unnecessary complexity, 
while still addressing the serious nature of social engineering threats.
